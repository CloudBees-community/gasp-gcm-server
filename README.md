Gasp! GCM for Android Demo Server
==================================================

Push data synchronization server for Gasp! Android demo: uses CloudBees PaaS and Foxweave to provide automatic data sync between Gasp! server and Android SQLite on-device data store. This version shows a standalone server app, with data sync triggered by a FoxWeave Integration Pipeline: the next version will be implemented as a FoxWeave Connector, obviating the need for a separate server deployment.
